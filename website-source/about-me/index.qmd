Hello! I’m originally from Dhaka, the vibrant capital city of Bangladesh. I came to the US in 2015 in pursuit of my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and lived in West Michigan before moving to Northern Virginia in 2022. Before joining Georgetown, I worked as a Computer Engineer, and then as a Data Analyst. 

I am currently pursuing a Master's of Science in Data Science & Analytics at Georgetown University. As I progress in my career, my passion lies in leveraging tailored data and algorithms to solve intricate business problems and communicating complex insights to non-technical stakeholders. Although I am not unfamiliar with the realm of software development, I was quite new to data analysis before I started my role at Shift Digital as a Data Analyst. I learned a lot of practical skills that are prevalent in the digital marketing industry. Being a part of the DSAN program has introduced a lot of theoretical and statistical concepts and I am looking forward to continue on this journey and grow my knowledge even further.

I love spending time in charming cafes and exploring new cuisines. During my downtime I enjoy reading, painting and watching movies/TV shows.
