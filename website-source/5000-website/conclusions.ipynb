    "**Data Gathering**: I utilized several sources to collect a diverse set of data, working with both text and record data to apply different machine learning algorithms. In hindsight, a larger dataset might have yielded more fruitful results. Nevertheless, I gained significant knowledge about web scraping methods for text data collection and the use of APIs for data gathering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Cleaning**: This is an iterative process and I learned its importance quite a bit through the experience of building the project. While cleaning the data it's absolutely necessary to ensure that the integrity is maintained. If data is not cleaned properly, several issues may arise later on while appyling different kinds of ML algorthims to the data at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Exploration**: This is my personal favorite stage in the Data Science lifecycle. Several insights and visualizations were genrated during this stage. Exploring the data uncovers many interesting facts and helps generate a more informative narrative to the data storytelling process. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Na√Øve Bayes**: Using python to carry out the naive bayes algorithm on both text and record data was hugely educational. It was interesting to get practical, hands on experience on training a model based on the naive bayes theory and observe how well it performs with unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dimensionality Reduction**: Observing how efficiently both PCA and t-SNE performs dimensionality reduction while preserving essential information was a highlight of the portfolio creation process. I was able to perform the two metholodogies and then create a comparison report for them both.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clustering**: Kmeans, dbscan and hierchical clustering all showed clear groupings within the dataset that were used to perform the clustering analyses. This helped observe the common characteristics amongst the automobile vehicles that are grouped together and the difference amongst the ones which are grouped farther apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Trees**: Performing the classfication and regression decision trees unraveled how well the datasets I collected perform with the decision tree algorithms provided by scikit-learn. It is an useful method of grouping text data and visualize the context within which certain keywords are being utilised.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ARM**: Yet another extremely beneficial algorithm when it comes to finding patterns in text data. The findings from this algorithm and how different words are connected was very insightful. Though this is a computationally intensive process and my result was likely not the most optimal one, it was still great to learn from the outcome."
