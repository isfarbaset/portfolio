# Machine Learning Analysis

This machine learning (ML) analysis focuses on Reddit discussions about U.S. states, aiming to uncover patterns and categorize conversations. Using advanced unsupervised learning techniques like **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**, we identify the dominant themes and visualize their distribution geographically. Each section dives into one aspect of state discussions, contributing to a broader understanding of state-based dynamics on Reddit. The data source for this analysis was the subreddit data

## Most Common Topics by State

### Overview
Using LDA, Reddit discussions were categorized into four primary topics:

1. **Tourism and Travel**
2. **Politics and Governance**
3. **Lifestyle and Culture**
4. **Economy and Business**

The most common topic for each state was identified and visualized on the interactive map below.

### Insights

#### **Tourism and Travel**
- States like **Florida**, **Nevada**, and **Hawaii** prominently feature travel-related discussions.
- These discussions are likely tied to vacation planning, major tourist attractions, and seasonal trends.

**Takeaway:** Travel topics reflect Reddit’s role in sharing experiences and discussing popular destinations with strong tourism appeal.

---

#### **Politics and Governance**
- States like **Montana**, **Washington**, **Arizona**, and **Michigan** dominate political discussions.
- These states likely feature political conversations tied to regional issues, legislative matters, and elections.

**Takeaway:** Political topics highlight regional political activity and Reddit’s ability to surface diverse political conversations.

---

#### **Lifestyle and Culture**
- States like **New York** and **Louisiana** lead in discussions about lifestyle and culture.
- These states are recognized for their unique traditions, festivals, food, and cultural diversity.

**Takeaway:** Discussions about lifestyle and culture reflect the importance of local traditions and regional identity in state-focused conversations.

---

#### **Economy and Business**
- States like **California** and **Texas** dominate commerce-related discussions.
- These discussions center around industries, employment opportunities, and economic trends in these major business hubs.

**Takeaway:** Economic topics highlight Reddit’s relevance in tracking business activity and labor market dynamics in key economic states.

### Context and Future Directions

#### Additional Perspectives
This is one of many analyses that explore Reddit discussions about U.S. states. Together with other insights, such as temporal trends, sentiment analysis, and subreddit-level dynamics, these findings provide a multifaceted view of online state discussions.

#### Next Steps
Further exploration could involve:

- **Temporal Trends:** How do discussions about topics like tourism and politics evolve over time?
- **Engagement Analysis:** Which topics drive the most interactions (upvotes and comments) on Reddit?
- **Subreddit Activity:** How do specific subreddits amplify or shape state discussions?

## Predicting the Score of a Post 

### Overview
Using different spark regression models, the goal was to see if we could determine the score of a post (the total of likes minus the total of dislikes) using the text of the post itself and whether a state is mentioned or not. The goal of this was to determine if the presence of certain states were able to predict the score of a post, which is a stand in for the popularity.

### Insights
Both a linear regression and random forest model were applied and both ended up with a RMSE of 68.3275. Two different models getting the same RMSE was a bit of a wake up call but the results were confirmed upon multile re-runs. It must be the case that 68.3275 is the best RMSE possible with the structure built in.

### Context and Future Directions

#### Additional Perspective
A RMSE of 68.3275 is not a great result especially given that the majority of posts only have a score in the thousands. This leads us to believe that a model predicting the score is not feasible and that a state being mentioned does not have a tangible effect on the score.

#### Next steps
Furhter exploration could involve:

- **Alternate Models:** We could try out other machine learning models to see if we could get better results.
- **Improved data cleaning:** The data could be further cleaned through normalization and text editting which would improve results
- **Change Target:** While this is more of an expansion, changing the feature being targetted could allow for us to learn what we want through a different measure.

## Predicting the subreddit based on the post

### Overview
Two machine learning models, Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression, were implemented in PySpark to categorize product descriptions into predefined categories (main_category). The models used a text-processing pipeline, including tokenization, TF-IDF feature extraction, and classification. Their performance was evaluated on various metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, precision, and AUC-ROC scores for each class.

### Insights

Random Forest Classifier achieved the best performance with following hyperparameters
- *Number of Features (HashingTF)* : 50000
- *Number of Trees* : 100
- *Max Depth* : 5

Logistic Regression achieved the best performance with the following hyperparameters
- *Number of Features (HashingTF)* : 10000
- *Regularization Parameter (RegParam)* : 0.1

![Comparison of ML Models](plots/comparison.png)

Both models achieve an AUC-ROC score greater than 0.5, indicating that they are capable of distinguishing between the categories of the subreddit with some level of reliability. However, the logistic regression model (AUC-ROC: 0.6739) performs better than the reinforcement model (AUC-ROC: 0.6251) in terms of distinguishing the classes in the main_category.

### Future Directions

Combine Random Forest and Logistic Regression for an ensemble model to leverage the strengths of both algorithms.
Explore advanced NLP models like BERT or Transformer-based architectures for better semantic understanding.

## Conclusion

By identifying the most common topic for each state, this analysis lays the groundwork for deeper investigations. Insights into Reddit conversations highlight the platform’s ability to capture real-world trends, opinions, and interests, making it a valuable source for understanding public discourse at a state level. Logistic Regression performs better in Accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC, making it the stronger model overall for predicting the subreddit based on the post.
